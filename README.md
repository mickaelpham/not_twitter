# Not Twitter [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mickaelpham/not_twitter.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/mickaelpham/not_twitter)

## Getting Started

```sh
git checkout https://github.com/mickaelpham/not_twitter.git
cd not_twitter
bundle install
rake db:migrate
rails server
```

Then open your web brower to `http://localhost:3000` and experiment!

## Deployment

Coming soon to [Heroku](https://heroku.com)!

## Where I want to go

  - [ ] Add the regular features from [Twitter](https://twitter.com) like reply and retweet.
  - [ ] Add client-side encryption (and explanation page).
  - [ ] Store user's public key and find a way to "ask" for the follower's key as well (TBD).
